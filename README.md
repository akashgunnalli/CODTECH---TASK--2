DURATION - 30TH NOV 2024 TO 15TH JAN 2025



OBJECTIVE-
Develop a Java program to track and manage student grades. The
 program should allow the user to input grades for different subjects or
 assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall
 grade along with any additional information (such as letter grade or
 GPA)

OVERVIEW 

The Java program is designed to track and manage student grades efficiently. It allows users to input grades for various subjects or assignments dynamically. Once all grades are entered, the program calculates the average grade and determines the overall performance by assigning a corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) based on standard grading criteria. Additionally, it computes the GPA on a 4.0 scale. The program ensures user-friendly interaction by validating inputs, handling invalid entries, and providing clear outputs. This application is a practical tool for evaluating academic performance and serves as an excellent example of implementing Java programming concepts like loops, arrays, conditional logic, and input validation.



CONCLUSION 

The Java program for tracking and managing student grades successfully demonstrates how to create an interactive and efficient application for evaluating academic performance. By allowing users to input grades dynamically, the program calculates the average grade and provides meaningful insights, such as the corresponding letter grade and GPA on a 4.0 scale. With built-in input validation and error handling, it ensures accuracy and reliability in processing user data. The program showcases the practical implementation of essential Java concepts, including loops, conditional statements, arrays, and user input handling. This application serves as a valuable tool for educators and students alike, offering a straightforward yet effective way to manage and analyze academic grades.
